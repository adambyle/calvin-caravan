# Calvin Caravan - CS336 Final Project

Traveling while in college is a very valuable experience for all students. Calvin has a wide variety of opportunities for its students to travel, whether it be studying abroad for a full semester or going on weekend or spring break trips. While Calvin hosts an off-campus programs fair each year, there isn’t a central online location to view every trip that exists across the community! There are posters across campus that not everyone can see, and countless different webpages for each trip type that make it difficult to actually know the scope of trips that are being planned or where to find them! That’s where Calvin Caravan will help!

Our website will allow users to view trips from across the campus community, see their dates, cost, and other details necessary to sign up for and consider joining a trip. They will be able to filter the trips based on these details in order to find a trip that fits their budget for money and time. For example, they could view all the spring break trips, wilderness trips, or study abroad trips and see their requirements all in one place. Given more time, the cherry on top for this vision would be going farther than Calvin-organized and sponsored trips. We would also like our website to allow users to post trip proposals and share their own trips with other students in the community. They can express interest in these proposals and get the contact information of the other students in order to continue planning.
